# 7 Supplier Diversity

All qualified organizations are encouraged to respond, including minority-owned and women-owned organizations.

SVCE is an equal opportunity employer. All responses will be evaluated under the same criteria. Pursuant to Proposition 209, a government entity such as SVCE is prohibited from granting preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment or public contracting.

RFP respondents that execute a contract with SVCE will be asked to complete a supplier diversity questionnaire. As a public agency and consistent with state law, SVCE will not use any provided information in any part of its selection process. Rather, SVCE will use the information to comply with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) reporting requirements. Pursuant to General Order 156 (GO156), SVCE is required to submit a detailed and verifiable annual plan and report on the utilization of women-owned, minority-owned, disabled veteran-owned and LGBT-owned business enterprises’ procurement. Consistent with the California Public Utilities Code and State policy objectives, SVCE will collect information regarding supplier diversity and labor practices from project developers and their subcontractors regarding past, current and/or planned efforts and policies.

SVCE encourages businesses that qualify for diverse business enterprise status to obtain certification through CPUC’s Supplier Diversity Clearinghouse. The certification is voluntary and cannot be used as a criterion for bid evaluation. For information on the certification process and requirements, please visit SVCE’s Supplier Diversity page.

# 8 Agreement Terms

Awardees will be required to enter into a contract using SVCE’s standard contract terms. Modification of the contract terms may be proposed by the Bidder for consideration by SVCE but are not guaranteed to be accepted. Rejection of the final terms from SVCE is grounds for disqualification.

SVCE’s standard contract terms are available for review in Appendix A.

# 9 California Public Records Act

All parties acknowledge that SVCE is a public agency subject to the requirements of the California Public Records Act, Cal. Gov. Code section 6250 et seq. (“CPRA”). SVCE will not disclose any part of any proposal before it announces a recommendation for an award, on the ground that there is a substantial public interest in not disclosing proposal during the evaluation process. After the announcement of a recommended award, all proposals received in response to this RFP will be subject to public disclosure, with the exception of those elements in each proposal which are exempt from disclosure pursuant to the CPRA.

If a Bidder believes there are portion(s) of the proposal which are exempt from disclosure, the Bidder must plainly mark it as “Confidential”, “Proprietary”, or “Trade Secret.” SVCE may also request that the Bidder state the specific provision of the CPRA which provides the exemption, and the factual basis for claiming the exemption. Any proposal which contains language purporting to render all or significant portions of the proposal as “Confidential,” “Trade Secret,” or “Propriety,” will be considered non-responsive and a public record in its entirety.

Although CPRA recognizes that certain confidential trade secret information may be protected from disclosure, SVCE may not be in a position to establish that the information a Bidder submits is a trade secret. If a public records request is made for information marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or “Trade Secret,” SVCE will provide the Bidder(s) who submitted the information with reasonable notice to seek protection from disclosure by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Bidder shall be solely responsible for taking such legal steps; if the Bidder takes no such action after receiving notice of the public records request, SVCE will disclose all records it deems subject to disclosure, even if marked “Confidential,” “Trade Secret,” or “Proprietary.”

# 10 Ex Parte Communication

Please note that to insure the proper and fair evaluation of a proposal, SVCE prohibits ex parte communication (i.e., unsolicited) initiated by the Bidder to an SVCE Official or Employee evaluating or considering the proposals prior to the time a bid decision has been made. Communication between Bidder and SVCE will be initiated by the appropriate Agency Official or Employee in order to obtain information or clarification needed to develop a proper and accurate evaluation of the proposal. Ex parte communication may be grounds for disqualifying the offending Bidder from consideration or award of the proposal, then in evaluation, or any future proposal.

# 11 Insurance Requirements

All insurance shall be secured from or countersigned by an agent or surety company recognized in good standing and authorized to do business in the State of California.

The Bidder shall, within thirty (30) days of notification of award and prior to commencement of work, take out and maintain in full force and effect minimum insurance coverage as specified in the attached requirements. This insurance shall remain in force and effect throughout the duration of the contract.

A certificate of existing insurance coverage should be submitted with the proposal as proof of insurability. If the current coverage does not meet the RFP requirements, then the Bidder should request an affidavit of insurability from the Bidder’s insurance agent that certifies the

# 12 Conflict of Interest/Statement of Non-Collusion

All bidders must disclose with their proposal the name of any officer, director, or agent who is also an employee of SVCE. Further, all bidders must disclose the name of any SVCE employee who owns, directly or indirectly, an interest of five percent (5%) or more of the bidder’s firm or any of its branches.

The Bidder shall certify that he/she has not, either directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in any collusion, or otherwise taken any action in restraint of free competitive bidding in connection with the proposal and that the bidder is not financially interested in, or otherwise affiliated in a business way with any other bidder on the same land or improvements.

# 13 Addenda

It is the Bidder’s responsibility to contact SVCE prior to submitting a proposal to ascertain if any addenda have been issued, to obtain all such addenda and return executed addenda with the proposal.

The failure of a Bidder to submit acknowledgement of any addenda that affects the proposal price(s) may be considered an irregularity and may be cause for rejection of the proposal.

# 14 Certifications

- Has read, understands and agrees to the information and requirements set forth in this RFP.
- Has the capability to complete the responsibilities and obligations of the proposal being submitted.

- Is eligible to submit a proposal because he/she is not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in a transaction by any Federal, State, or local department or agency.

# 15 Rights of SVCE

SVCE at its sole discretion reserves the right to waive technicalities or irregularities, to reject any or all proposals, and/or to accept that proposal which is in the best interest of SVCE.
